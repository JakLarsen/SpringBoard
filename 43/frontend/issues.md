RESOLVED

- Companies overflowing vertically above and below page
    - Solution: I gave the component overflow:scroll and removed align-items:center from the container in RouteHandler.css





UNRESOLVED

- Clicking login or signup button from home widget doesn't update their navlinks to active/focused color-style
- Need to figure out how to swap out which Navbar links are displayed when logged in/out
