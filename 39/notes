React



A main goal
 - give us a lightweight frontend framework to help us create reusable components and modular applications

Components 
 - the building blocks, UI + Logic generally
 - Write a function that returns HTML-esque code to render

 Scripts (Must be in that order)
  - React
  - ReactDOM
    - (Takes a components to render and a location on the DOM to add it)
  - Babel - transpiles jsx into js

JSX and Properties
 - JavaScript Syntax Extension
 - Properties are IMMUTABLE and cannot change

traditional class-based react vs newer function-based
