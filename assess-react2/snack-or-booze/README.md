#Snack or Booze 

- Snack-or-booze is a simply-designed restaurant app that allows users to check out an assortment of drinks and snacks from a mock-up restaurant.
- Users can:
    - View the snacks or drinks menus.
    - View individual snacks or drinks and information about them.
    - Add a snack to the snack menu or a drink to the drink menu.
    - View their current order.
    - Add or remove any snacks or drinks from the menu to and from their order.
- The exercise itself was built around learning and using good practices in React.js
- Basic useState with forms, useEffect, useHistory, and general React-Router were the primary focus, with useContext being unncessary but potentially an optional inclusion to reduce minor prop-drilling.
-Enjoy!
