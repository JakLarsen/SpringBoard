- All elements of a tree are referred to as Nodes
- Ancestors are any nodes that are above the anscestorial line of a node
- Parents are any nodes that are directly above some other node
- Children are any nodes that are directly connected below some other nodes
- Descendents are any nodes that are in the descendent line of a node
- Root node - the top of the tree (necessity in a tree)
    - Think HTML element in a DOM tree, etc.
- Leaf node - a node without children - the end of the line



                    Binary tree

- A node can have at MOST 2 children  (0,1,2)

                    n-ary tree
    
- Generic tree with no constraint on node children

                    DEPTH FIRST SEARCH

- UTILIZES A STACK
- Good for finding if something exists in a tree

                    BREDTH FIRST SEARCH
    
- UTILIZES A QUEUE
- Good for finding the highest or lowest tier of duplicate node values in a tree
- How to figure out what levle the lowest tier of match is???
